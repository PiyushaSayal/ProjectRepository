This project demonstrates an extensive use of PySpark for data processing and analysis, focusing on flight data. It covers data ingestion from CSV files, exploratory data analysis, data manipulation including filtering, aggregation, and joining datasets. Additionally, it delves into advanced data engineering techniques like column transformations, handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding, and building a machine learning pipeline for binary classification using logistic regression. The project aims to predict flight delays, showcasing the use of cross-validation for model tuning to optimize performance metrics.
